## Description
Challenge/stress-test for the end of the "Prairie" period of the BeCode training, promotion Lovelace-2.

**Technical objectives:** 
* Create an animation using html/css (expected result: https://github.com/quang-le/css-animation-drill/blob/master/images/css_animation_exercise_4.png);
* Save it on a github repo;
* Deploy it as a GitHub page;
* Write a README file;

**Date of the test:** 25/05/2018, from 9h30 to 16h30;

**Completed on:** 25/05/2015, 15h;

## Learning outcomes
list of objectives available at https://becodeorg.github.io/end-of-prairie-technical-drill/criteria.html

1. **Self-learning**
* Used https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_transform.asp to figure out how to rotate elements;
* tried to use one `@keyframes` for the whole animation, but switched to chaining several small ones after finding out it was possible (via stackoverflow);
* Realized it `animation-iteration` used on multiple `@keyframes` would only repeat the last one, so repeating the whole animation would require using a big one to centralize all elements;
* Followed instructions from github to deploy https://son-css-challenge.tk;
* Figured out creating a custom url for Github Pages adds a file on the master branch, so `pull`is necessary straightafterwards (or maybe branching would've been useful for thisproject after all);
* Asked peers for help with solving `@keyframes` sequence issue (solved by using `animation-delay`);
* Learned to use the `animation`shorthand i.o. individual properties;

2. **Git**
* Created repo as requested;
* Committed at every step described in the challenge;
* Pushed at 10h40, 12h30, then after completion of step 7;
* Branching didn't seem necessary, as there was no collaboration and mistakes could be easily reverted using the IDE;

3. **Markdown**
* I hope this README helps;

4. **html&css**
* You be the judge;

5. **Deploy**
* deployed on http://son-css-challenge.tk/;
